- link: https://901522ec-fa4d-4b63-aecc-a237dc24ac90.mock.pstmn.io/jobs/
# Visualizations and libraries 
- This application incoporates a map visualization using the Leaflet.js library and a chart visualization using the CanvasJs.com library
- This visualizations are intedned to help users visualize the locations of the jobs generated from the API, and the skills most in demand based on the job descriptions generated from the API. 
# CSS frameworks
- There are no CSS frameworks used in the code. All CSS styles are defined in the external "style.css" file. Leaflet also provides a default CSS file for styling the map components which is provided in the HTML code.
# Problem and solution 
This application aims to explore various data related to job postings such as job titles and descriptions, sources of job postings, job locations, and in-demand skills based on job descriptions. The primary goal of the application is to assist new college graduates from UMD in finding employment in metropolitan areas. Although the current data used for the application is limited to the Bay area, access to more data will help expand the location pool, particularly to include the DC metropolitan area.

The application provides students with a range of benefits such as job listings, insights into skills that are in demand by major employers (which can be used to better tailor their resume), recommendations on suitable job opportunities based on their major, and highlights skills to emphasize for different job titles. These features are especially valuable for new graduates who may be uncertain about which career path to pursue due to limited work experience.

It is important to note that the API currently only drives data for the home page (index.html).
